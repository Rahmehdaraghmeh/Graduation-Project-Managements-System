## Overview

Managing graduation projects in universities can be inefficient and scattered. The **Graduation Project Management System (GPMS)** is a web-based platform designed to streamline the lifecycle of graduation projects — from proposal submission to final evaluation — for students, supervisors, and administrators.

## Features

* Authentication & Role Management
* Project Proposal Submission & Approval
* Team & Supervisor Assignment
* Milestone & Deadline Tracking
* Document Management (reports, presentations, code)
* Evaluation & Grading with rubrics
* Dashboards for students, supervisors, and admins

## User Stories

### Students

* Submit project proposals for review.
* Track deadlines and milestones.
* Upload progress reports and deliverables.

### Supervisors

* Approve or reject proposals.
* Provide feedback on milestones.
* Evaluate students using standardized rubrics.

### Admins

* Create and manage user accounts.
* Monitor all projects from a centralized dashboard.
* Generate reports for departmental analysis.

## System Architecture

* **Frontend:** React.js (responsive web UI)
* **Backend:** Node.js (Express or Nest.js)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Authentication:** JWT / OAuth2
* **Deployment:** Cloud (AWS / GCP / Azure)
